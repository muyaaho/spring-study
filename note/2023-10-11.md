## Spring Framework - Important Terminology

- @Component (..): An instance of class will be managed by Spring framework
- Dependency: GameRunner needs GamingConsole implement!
    - GamingConsole Impl(ex: MarioGame) is a dependency of GameRunner
- Component Scan: How does Spring Framework find component classes?
    - It scans packages(`@ComponentScan(”com.in28minutes”))`)
- Dependency Injection: Identifiy beans, their dependencies and wire them together(provides IOC - Inversion of Control)
    - Spring Beans: An object managed by Spring Framework
    - IoC container: Manages the lifecycle of beans and dependencies
        - types: ApplicationContext(complex), BeanFactort(simpler features - rarely used)
    - Autowiring: Process of wiring in dependencies for a Spring Bean

## `@Component` vs `@Bean`

| Heading | @Component | @Bean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where? | 모든 자바 클래스에서 사용 가능  | 보통 Spring Configuration 클래스에서 사용 |
| Ease of use | annotation만 추가하면 됨 | 모든 코드 작성해야 됨 |
| Autowiring | Yes - Field, Setter or Constructor Injection 중에 하나 | Yes - method call or method parameters |
| Who create Beans? | Spring Framework | bean creation code 작성해야 됨 |
| Recommended For | Instantiating Beans for Your Own Application Code: @Component | 1. Custom Buiness Logic
2. Instantiating Beans for 3rd-party libraries: @Bean |
